### pdf-comment-remover.txt
This code is used to automate the removal of comments in a PDF.
To run this file you should install Power Automate Desktop. It can be downloaded here for free (<https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/>). 

The file is coded in a language native to power automate called Microsoft Power Fx. 
If the file does not automatically open on power automate desktop, one can copy the contents of the file and paste it in a new flow on the application.  
Before running the flow please check if PDFs open with Adobe Acrobat by default, if not then this flow will not work.
It takes approximately 10 seconds to remove all the comments on one file.
